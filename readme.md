# A fork of BitStorm, now with Redis support!

## What is BitStorm
BitStorm is a super-thin bittorrent tracker written in PHP which does not require a database.
BitStorm was originally written by Peter Caprioli as a lightweight bittorrent tracker contained in a single PHP file. As it used only a single flat file as a database, it had difficulty handling ~10 announces per second. You can find more detail [here](https://stormhub.org/tracker/ui.php)
Peter has rewrote the code with MySQL support. Josh Duff forked the beta MySQL code and  published it on [Google Code](https://code.google.com/p/bitstorm/), allowing it to scale a huge number of peers.

**This version is rewrited based on the bitstorm using redis as its database.**

## What is a Bittorrent Tracker
Tracker is an HTTP/HTTPS service which responds to HTTP GET requests from bittorrent clients such as utorrent. In a word, a tracker maintains information about which peers are downloading a common file.
Read [BitTorrent Protocol Specification](http://www.bittorrent.org/beps/bep_0003.html) for a brief introduction about bittorrent and tracker. More detailed Specification can be found in [wiki.theory.org](https://wiki.theory.org/BitTorrentSpecification#Tracker_Response) and [wiki.bitcomet.com](http://wiki.bitcomet.com/inside_bitcomet).

## Data layout

| # | key				| expire | value-type   | value
|---| ----------------- | ------ | ------------ | ------------
| 1 | torrents			| NA     | set			| info_hash1,info_hash2...
| 2 | info_hash			| NA     | set			| peer_id1,peer_id2...
| 3 | info_hash:peer_id | 1860s  | hash			| ip4,ip6,port,seed

* **info_hash**: sha1 hash of the bencoded form of the info value from the metainfo file(.torrent file), can identify the real file to be transfered.
* **peer_id**: identifier of client, generated/changed by the client at startup. Another similay parameter is **key** which is identifier of client and generated/changed by the client when a new session starts.
* **seed**: a peer is seeding when he has 0 bytes left to download, otherwise he is leeching.

## Features
1. Redis as storage.
2. Both ipv4 and ipv6 supported. The compact field is ignored to support ipv6.
3. NAT are naturally supported without extra effort.
4. A stats page using [datatable](http://www.datatables.net/).

## Usage
1. Place the contents in the document root of a php-supported server.
2. Run `composer install` to download Predis.
3. Make sure your redis server can be accessed.
4. Make a torrent and fill tracker as the following URLs(If port absents, 80 will be used)
```
http://youripv4:port/announce

http://[youripv6]:port/announce
```
5. Visit `http://yourip:port/announce` or `http://yourip:port/stats.php` in a broswer to see the statistics of the running tracker.
